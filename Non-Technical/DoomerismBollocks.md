# Why Climate Doomerism is Bollocks

NOTE: this article is primarily for my own benefit, I need to get all of this information out in a single place myself so I don't fall into the unhelpful trap of climate doomerism. As such, do not take this as gospel, this isn't scientific, this is just something I'm collecting to alleviate my own fears, and hopefully others too (if you happen to stumble across this)

I recently had an extended anxiety spell, coupled with a lengthy conversation with a friend about the climate, that left me feeling incredibly down about the state of the world. There are communities online (on reddit, of course) that insist that our whole society and way of living will collapse some time in the next 20 years. I admit, I have sometimes, in my lowest moments, bought into this tripe. Having thought about this with a clear head, however, I now realise it is utter bollocks.

I should preface this by saying that I believe that climate change is real and caused by humans, it is currently having extremely unfortunate effects on earth and will continue to do so unless it is brought under control by us in the next few years, ideally now, in fact.

The good news is, however, that this is happening.

## What we have done in the past

- The Montreal Protocols essentially eliminated the use of CFC gasses on a global scale, thereby *patching the hole in the ozone layer*. Did you know that? Remember when people wouldn't shut up about the hole in the ozone layer? It's literally gone now because we fixed it. [Source video by Simon Clark, a very cool youtuber I think you should check out](https://youtu.be/jtI27ODuukg)
- Lead!!! The presence of lead in the atmosphere and food and water supply has caused untold damage to previous generations. 90% of children born in the U.S. between 1951 and 1980 had blood-lead levels higher than the CDC threshold. On average, early childhood exposure to lead resulted in a 2.6-point drop in IQ per person ([Source](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20220308/half-us-adults-exposed-harmful-lead-levels-as-children)). But it's been banned, in the UK, where I live, leaded gasoline, the biggest contributor to this brain damage, was banned in 2000 under the Blair government (least he was good for something lmfao), this means that anyone born after then, including myself, can expect a slightly higher on average intelligence than the generation before. Result!
  - Lead poisoning also causes Irritability and Mood disorders, High blood pressure, Joint and muscle pain, Difficulties with memory or concentration, and Miscarriage, stillbirth or premature birth in pregnant people. All of which are present in modern-day "boomers"

## Addressing the "Society Will Collapse By 2040" Myth

- Climate tech is increasing at an *incredible* rate, for example: 
  - smart grid/grid expansion
  - alternative protein (cell based meat)
  - electrification (cars, as one example)
  - carbon capture
  - battery tech
  - alternative fuels (green hydrogen for example)
- Do you really think that, in 20,000 years of human history, we only have, like, 18 left? The odds of that, statistically speaking, must be astronomical
- [Here](https://www.richardcarrier.info/archives/19497) is a fucking tremendous breakdown of the paper in question, this "MIT" paper, that is not affiliated with MIT in any way, really, and explains why this kind of thing is just bad science
- Reddit user u/essendoubleop on a post in r/videos entitled "MIT Has Predicted that Society Will Collapse in 2040"

> [People have been predicting similar societal collapses constantly throughout human history.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dates_predicted_for_apocalyptic_events)  Extrapolating with pre existing variables becomes problematic when you have many unforseen (sic.) variables introduced into the model.  
> How would they have foreseen nitrate fertilization to increase crop yields when they didn't even know nitrates existed?  How could they have foreseen global internet connectivity when they didn't even know what an electronic computer was? 
> There are things coming down the pipeline that we wouldn't have a clue of in our modern times, but with the privilege of hindsight we can say how easy it is to make sense of.

- From the same video by user u/AcidicAzide 

> So, 50 years ago, an MIT scientist developed an economic model and simulated it with a computer. Considering the computational power available at the time, the model must have been extremely simple compared to the economic models that are routinely used nowadays. In other words, any predictions coming out of this model are likely very inaccurate if not outright wrong.
> Then a random youtuber makes a video about this 50 fucking years old model and its most likely completely irrelevant predictions and reddit promptly freaks out. *facepalm*
> EDIT: Guys, astronomers with their clusters of supercomputers and millions of CPU cores can't predict where an asteroid orbiting the sun will end up in more than 10 years. Even though they know the underlying physics which is quite simple compared to the mechanisms behind economics, sociology or politics. Yet, you think that an economist from 1970s would be able to predict something 70 years in the future on a computer with the power of a calculator?

- And another one from u/py_a_thon

> Did MIT predict this or did a biased algo predict this?
> Also: There is no reason to think a full sociology level collapse is even capable of occurring any time soon. I am literally using my drunk ass meat fingers to turn electrons into chars. We can farm asteroids soon. So many tech advancements are on the near horizon.
> Chill out. Smart people solve problems. They always have and they always will. If you do not enjoy putting your fate in the hands of others...then go learn how to solve some problem without causing more problems(if possible). Or take care if yourself and fuck everyone else.
> This is ridiculous. People are going to be chillin in 20 years. That is literally my goal for life. I want everyone to be less stupid, I want some people to shut the fuck up(not forever, just sometimes) and I want others to just be cool.

## Reasons To Be Positive About Our Collective Response To Climate Change

### Comment by u/grundar

Reddit user grundar responded to a post on the r/ChangeMyView subreddit (entitled "CMV: Society will collapse in my lifetime due to climate change") that answers this question so comprehensively I thought I would hive it its own section

> based on current climate change models from the IPCC, we are on track for 3 degrees of warming and limiting warming to 1.5 or 2 degrees is extremely unlikely and a pipe dream at this point.

Fortunately, this is not correct.

Two high-level analyses first:  
 * (a)  [Already-announced pledges and targets would hold warming to 1.8C](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/cat-thermometer/) (assuming they're met).  
 * (b) [Current IEA estimates are for 1.8-2.2C of total warming by 2100](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac4ebf), with the lower end based on already-announced pledges (APS) and the higher end based on currently-enacted policies (STEPS).  When you look at [what a low bar the IEA scenarios represent](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2021/executive-summary) and [how laughably pessimistic IEA projections for clean energy have been](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2020/07/12/has-the-international-energy-agency-finally-improved-at-forecasting-solar-growth/), it seems likely that their forecast is not too wildly optimistic.

Next, a little detail on why that estimate is plausible.

**(1) Warming stops once CO2 emissions stop.**  
The recent [IPCC report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf) indicates warming will stop quite quickly after net zero is reached.  If you're curious about the science behind that, [here's an explainer at Carbon Brief that goes into more detail](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-will-global-warming-stop-as-soon-as-net-zero-emissions-are-reached).

**(2) 3C of warming requires maintaining current emissions until 2060.**  
[p.14 of the IPCC report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf) shows that to hit 3C of warming (by 2100, so a long life for you) means exceeding emissions scenario SSP2-4.5.  p.12 shows that emissions scenario SSP2-4.5 means CO2 emissions stay above their current level until 2060.

**(3) CO2 emissions are highly likely to start declining before 2040, likely before 2030.**  
The IEA analysis, above, makes a strong case for this; however, additional factors that you can look at individually:  
 * [Renewables are now virtually all net new electricity generation worldwide.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/01/renewable-energy-has-another-record-year-of-growth-says-iea)  
 * [World coal consumption peaked almost a decade ago](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/coal.html.html#coal-consumption)  
 * [The growth rate of CO2 emissions decreased by 80% from 2005 to 2019](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions#year-on-year-change-in-global-co2-emissions)  
 * [EVs replace millions of ICE cars every year, and will be a **majority** of the global car market by 2034](https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/24/BNEF-Zero-Emission-Vehicles-Factbook_FINAL.pdf)

There's still a great deal of work to be done, but people often underestimate the tangible progress that has already been made.

> Thank you for this. This made me slightly less suicidal lol

That's literally why I wrote it.

The "we're doomed" narrative (and the [intentional disinformation that pushes it](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/27/climatologist-michael-e-mann-doomism-climate-crisis-interview)) is making a great many people very anxious, some to the point of real, tangible suffering.  That narrative is *not* founded in science (that previous link goes to an interview with the lead author of the 3rd IPCC report where he says as much), so not only are people anxious and suffering needlessly, they're suffering based on false information.  That helps nothing (and is [likely counter-productive](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/doomsday-scenarios-are-as-harmful-as-climate-change-denial/2017/07/12/880ed002-6714-11e7-a1d7-9a32c91c6f40_story.html)).

That's not to say climate change is not a real and urgent problem -- it is!  It's to say that we should deal with it the way we deal with any other important problem -- by learning about it, making a plan to fix it, and then step-by-step following through on that plan.

Right now, as I see it, we've just transitioned into that last step.  We fundamentally have all of the technology required to keep warming to 2C, and more-or-less at prices needed to drive its adoption.  What's needed now is to follow through, step-by-step replacing the old, dirty infrastructure with the new, clean infrastructure.  There are some edge cases to work out (long-distance flights, scalable carbon capture, cement), but 80-90% of the problem is a matter of construction at this point.

There is still urgency -- every 0.1C of warming will cause more suffering and death -- but that's exactly why it's important to not allow our motivation to get sapped by wallowing in doom and despair.

### Comment by u/theskyisnotthelimit

I think you're overlooking some things here, so I'll try my best to give you a tiny bit of hope:

1) Economics.  [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUySXZ6y2fk) reviews a relatively optimistic report released recently by a  climate group who also have a good track record of predicting things.  In short, your assumption that it takes decades to transition to sustainability is false. New, industry-disrupting technologies are adopted incredibly quickly, from 0-99% penetration within 20 years.  Just think of how quickly smartphones were adopted around the world.  75% of GHG emissions come from producing power; green energy and EVs are already exploding in popularity and being adopted much more quickly than anyone anticipated.  

Carbon neutral steel and concrete are already hitting the market, and the financial effects of climate change are hitting hard, encouraging [trillions in divestment](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/12/fossil-fuel-divestment-funds-double-5tn-in-a-year) from the fossil fuel industry and increasingly green investment strategies.(anecdotally, my bank's sustainable mutual funds have been breaking records for growth)

2) Human Ingenuity.  Humans don't just lay down and die, a statement which is terrifying or encouraging depending on how you look at it.  "Experts" have been predicting food shortages  and societal collapse for centuries now due to population growth, but it has never materialized.  This is because of unforeseen innovations that completely change the way things are done, again in a relatively short space of time.  

Food systems can change in the blink of an eye.  For example, commercial bananas went extinct in the 1950's but were replaced by a different breed of banana without consumers even noticing. Research is already ongoing into new crops that can be grown, as well as new methods (such as hydroponics and vertical farms), and even ways to manipulate the weather (it's already been done in places like China, Dubai, and Texas to induce rain).

3) Biology. Fighting climate change is not 100% lowering GHG emissions. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpTHi7O66pI&list=LL&index=6) shows a different side of climate change caused by human-induced desertification.  The scientist speaking also shows how quickly, easily, and affordably desertification can be reversed.  Bringing back these green areas helps sequester more carbon, lower local temperatures, and even reduce the impact of flooding and storms.

Also:

That study about aerosols raising temperatures admits that the effects were highly localized to industrialized nations. The [IPCC itself](https://www.carbonbrief.org/cutting-air-pollution-would-not-cause-near-term-spike-in-global-warming) found that removing aerosols would only raise temperatures by "a few tenths of a degree", and is unlikely to cause a spike in temperature.

It's easy to be pessimistic about politicians and financial structures, but you only hear about the stupid things they do.  But on the other hand, most [European countries](https://www.greenmatch.co.uk/blog/2019/10/greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-country)(scroll down in that link), and many [Canadian provinces](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-indicators/greenhouse-gas-emissions.html)(go to regional tab) have managed to reduce CO2 emissions to below 1990 levels. [Latin American](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.KT?locations=ZJ) and [Chinese](https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/china-co2-emissions/) emissions are decreasing since 2015, and the [US's](https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/us-co2-emissions/) is declining as well.  China also recently instituted a carbon tax.  None of this is working fast enough right now, but it will accelerate due to the economic factors I indicated earlier.

Right now, we are investing in the future.  Investing in solutions that will mitigate climate change and prevent large-scale death and devastation.  These investments will take time to pay off, but once they do it will have an exponential effect on CO2 emissions.  

Just like the effects of GHG emissions are delayed, the effects of our mitigation actions now will also be delayed, but once in place they will work much faster than our natural systems do. I mean, I wouldn't buy oceanfront property and there will certainly be a lot of struggles, but there have always been struggles, and we usually survive in spite of ourselves.
