# Climate Doomerism is Bad

NOTE: this article is primarily for my own benefit, I need to get all of this information out in a single place myself so I don't fall into the unhelpful trap of climate doomerism. As such, do not take this as gospel, this isn't scientific, this is just something I'm collecting to alleviate my own fears, and hopefully others too (if you happen to stumble across this)

I recently had an extended anxiety spell, coupled with a lengthy conversation with a friend about the climate, that left me feeling incredibly down about the state of the world. There are communities online (on reddit, of course) that insist that our whole society and way of living will collapse some time in the next 20 years. I admit, I have sometimes, in my lowest moments, bought into this tripe. Having thought about this with a clear head, however, I now realise it is utter bollocks.

I should preface this by saying that I believe that climate change is real and caused by humans, it is currently having extremely unfortunate effects on earth and will continue to do so unless it is brought under control by us in the next few years, ideally now, in fact.

The good news is, however, that this is happening.

## What we have done in the past

- The Montreal Protocols essentially eliminated the use of CFC gasses on a global scale, thereby *patching the hole in the ozone layer*. Did you know that? Remember when people wouldn't shut up about the hole in the ozone layer? It's literally gone now because we fixed it. [Source video by Simon Clark, a very cool youtuber I think you should check out](https://youtu.be/jtI27ODuukg)
- Lead!!! The presence of lead in the atmosphere and food and water supply has caused untold damage to previous generations. 90% of children born in the U.S. between 1951 and 1980 had blood-lead levels higher than the CDC threshold. On average, early childhood exposure to lead resulted in a 2.6-point drop in IQ per person ([Source](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20220308/half-us-adults-exposed-harmful-lead-levels-as-children)). But it's been banned, in the UK, where I live, leaded gasoline, the biggest contributor to this brain damage, was banned in 2000 under the Blair government (least he was good for something lmfao), this means that anyone born after then, including myself, can expect a slightly higher on average intelligence than the generation before. Result!
  - Lead poisoning also causes Irritability and Mood disorders, High blood pressure, Joint and muscle pain, Difficulties with memory or concentration, and Miscarriage, stillbirth or premature birth in pregnant people. All of which are present in modern-day "boomers"

## Addressing the "Society Will Collapse By 2040" Myth

- Climate tech is increasing at an *incredible* rate, for example: 
  - smart grid/grid expansion
  - alternative protein (cell based meat)
  - electrification (cars, as one example)
  - carbon capture
  - battery tech
  - alternative fuels (green hydrogen for example)
- Do you really think that, in 20,000 years of human history, we only have, like, 18 left? The odds of that, statistically speaking, must be astronomical
- [Here](https://www.richardcarrier.info/archives/19497) is a fucking tremendous breakdown of the paper in question, this "MIT" paper, that is not affiliated with MIT in any way, really, and explains why this kind of thing is just bad science
- Reddit user u/essendoubleop on a post in r/videos entitled "MIT Has Predicted that Society Will Collapse in 2040"

> [People have been predicting similar societal collapses constantly throughout human history.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dates_predicted_for_apocalyptic_events)  Extrapolating with pre existing variables becomes problematic when you have many unforseen (sic.) variables introduced into the model.  
> How would they have foreseen nitrate fertilization to increase crop yields when they didn't even know nitrates existed?  How could they have foreseen global internet connectivity when they didn't even know what an electronic computer was? 
> There are things coming down the pipeline that we wouldn't have a clue of in our modern times, but with the privilege of hindsight we can say how easy it is to make sense of.

- From the same video by user u/AcidicAzide 

> So, 50 years ago, an MIT scientist developed an economic model and simulated it with a computer. Considering the computational power available at the time, the model must have been extremely simple compared to the economic models that are routinely used nowadays. In other words, any predictions coming out of this model are likely very inaccurate if not outright wrong.
> Then a random youtuber makes a video about this 50 fucking years old model and its most likely completely irrelevant predictions and reddit promptly freaks out. *facepalm*
> EDIT: Guys, astronomers with their clusters of supercomputers and millions of CPU cores can't predict where an asteroid orbiting the sun will end up in more than 10 years. Even though they know the underlying physics which is quite simple compared to the mechanisms behind economics, sociology or politics. Yet, you think that an economist from 1970s would be able to predict something 70 years in the future on a computer with the power of a calculator?

- And another one from u/py_a_thon

> Did MIT predict this or did a biased algo predict this?
> Also: There is no reason to think a full sociology level collapse is even capable of occurring any time soon. I am literally using my drunk ass meat fingers to turn electrons into chars. We can farm asteroids soon. So many tech advancements are on the near horizon.
> Chill out. Smart people solve problems. They always have and they always will. If you do not enjoy putting your fate in the hands of others...then go learn how to solve some problem without causing more problems(if possible). Or take care if yourself and fuck everyone else.

## Reasons To Be Positive About Our Collective Response To Climate Change

### Comment by u/grundar

Reddit user grundar responded to a post on the r/ChangeMyView subreddit (entitled "CMV: Society will collapse in my lifetime due to climate change") that answers this question so comprehensively I thought I would hive it its own section

> based on current climate change models from the IPCC, we are on track for 3 degrees of warming and limiting warming to 1.5 or 2 degrees is extremely unlikely and a pipe dream at this point.

Fortunately, this is not correct.

Two high-level analyses first:  
 * (a)  [Already-announced pledges and targets would hold warming to 1.8C](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/cat-thermometer/) (assuming they're met).  
 * (b) [Current IEA estimates are for 1.8-2.2C of total warming by 2100](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac4ebf), with the lower end based on already-announced pledges (APS) and the higher end based on currently-enacted policies (STEPS).  When you look at [what a low bar the IEA scenarios represent](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2021/executive-summary) and [how laughably pessimistic IEA projections for clean energy have been](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2020/07/12/has-the-international-energy-agency-finally-improved-at-forecasting-solar-growth/), it seems likely that their forecast is not too wildly optimistic.

Next, a little detail on why that estimate is plausible.

**(1) Warming stops once CO2 emissions stop.**  
The recent [IPCC report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf) indicates warming will stop quite quickly after net zero is reached.  If you're curious about the science behind that, [here's an explainer at Carbon Brief that goes into more detail](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-will-global-warming-stop-as-soon-as-net-zero-emissions-are-reached).

**(2) 3C of warming requires maintaining current emissions until 2060.**  
[p.14 of the IPCC report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf) shows that to hit 3C of warming (by 2100, so a long life for you) means exceeding emissions scenario SSP2-4.5.  p.12 shows that emissions scenario SSP2-4.5 means CO2 emissions stay above their current level until 2060.

**(3) CO2 emissions are highly likely to start declining before 2040, likely before 2030.**  
The IEA analysis, above, makes a strong case for this; however, additional factors that you can look at individually:  
 * [Renewables are now virtually all net new electricity generation worldwide.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/01/renewable-energy-has-another-record-year-of-growth-says-iea)  
 * [World coal consumption peaked almost a decade ago](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/coal.html.html#coal-consumption)  
 * [The growth rate of CO2 emissions decreased by 80% from 2005 to 2019](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions#year-on-year-change-in-global-co2-emissions)  
 * [EVs replace millions of ICE cars every year, and will be a **majority** of the global car market by 2034](https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/24/BNEF-Zero-Emission-Vehicles-Factbook_FINAL.pdf)

There's still a great deal of work to be done, but people often underestimate the tangible progress that has already been made.

> Thank you for this. This made me slightly less suicidal lol

That's literally why I wrote it.

The "we're doomed" narrative (and the [intentional disinformation that pushes it](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/27/climatologist-michael-e-mann-doomism-climate-crisis-interview)) is making a great many people very anxious, some to the point of real, tangible suffering.  That narrative is *not* founded in science (that previous link goes to an interview with the lead author of the 3rd IPCC report where he says as much), so not only are people anxious and suffering needlessly, they're suffering based on false information.  That helps nothing (and is [likely counter-productive](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/doomsday-scenarios-are-as-harmful-as-climate-change-denial/2017/07/12/880ed002-6714-11e7-a1d7-9a32c91c6f40_story.html)).

That's not to say climate change is not a real and urgent problem -- it is!  It's to say that we should deal with it the way we deal with any other important problem -- by learning about it, making a plan to fix it, and then step-by-step following through on that plan.

Right now, as I see it, we've just transitioned into that last step.  We fundamentally have all of the technology required to keep warming to 2C, and more-or-less at prices needed to drive its adoption.  What's needed now is to follow through, step-by-step replacing the old, dirty infrastructure with the new, clean infrastructure.  There are some edge cases to work out (long-distance flights, scalable carbon capture, cement), but 80-90% of the problem is a matter of construction at this point.

There is still urgency -- every 0.1C of warming will cause more suffering and death -- but that's exactly why it's important to not allow our motivation to get sapped by wallowing in doom and despair.

### Comment by u/theskyisnotthelimit

I think you're overlooking some things here, so I'll try my best to give you a tiny bit of hope:

1) Economics.  [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUySXZ6y2fk) reviews a relatively optimistic report released recently by a  climate group who also have a good track record of predicting things.  In short, your assumption that it takes decades to transition to sustainability is false. New, industry-disrupting technologies are adopted incredibly quickly, from 0-99% penetration within 20 years.  Just think of how quickly smartphones were adopted around the world.  75% of GHG emissions come from producing power; green energy and EVs are already exploding in popularity and being adopted much more quickly than anyone anticipated.  

Carbon neutral steel and concrete are already hitting the market, and the financial effects of climate change are hitting hard, encouraging [trillions in divestment](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/12/fossil-fuel-divestment-funds-double-5tn-in-a-year) from the fossil fuel industry and increasingly green investment strategies.(anecdotally, my bank's sustainable mutual funds have been breaking records for growth)

2) Human Ingenuity.  Humans don't just lay down and die, a statement which is terrifying or encouraging depending on how you look at it.  "Experts" have been predicting food shortages  and societal collapse for centuries now due to population growth, but it has never materialized.  This is because of unforeseen innovations that completely change the way things are done, again in a relatively short space of time.  

Food systems can change in the blink of an eye.  For example, commercial bananas went extinct in the 1950's but were replaced by a different breed of banana without consumers even noticing. Research is already ongoing into new crops that can be grown, as well as new methods (such as hydroponics and vertical farms), and even ways to manipulate the weather (it's already been done in places like China, Dubai, and Texas to induce rain).

3) Biology. Fighting climate change is not 100% lowering GHG emissions. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpTHi7O66pI&list=LL&index=6) shows a different side of climate change caused by human-induced desertification.  The scientist speaking also shows how quickly, easily, and affordably desertification can be reversed.  Bringing back these green areas helps sequester more carbon, lower local temperatures, and even reduce the impact of flooding and storms.

Also:

That study about aerosols raising temperatures admits that the effects were highly localized to industrialized nations. The [IPCC itself](https://www.carbonbrief.org/cutting-air-pollution-would-not-cause-near-term-spike-in-global-warming) found that removing aerosols would only raise temperatures by "a few tenths of a degree", and is unlikely to cause a spike in temperature.

It's easy to be pessimistic about politicians and financial structures, but you only hear about the stupid things they do.  But on the other hand, most [European countries](https://www.greenmatch.co.uk/blog/2019/10/greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-country)(scroll down in that link), and many [Canadian provinces](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-indicators/greenhouse-gas-emissions.html)(go to regional tab) have managed to reduce CO2 emissions to below 1990 levels. [Latin American](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.KT?locations=ZJ) and [Chinese](https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/china-co2-emissions/) emissions are decreasing since 2015, and the [US's](https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/us-co2-emissions/) is declining as well.  China also recently instituted a carbon tax.  None of this is working fast enough right now, but it will accelerate due to the economic factors I indicated earlier.

Right now, we are investing in the future.  Investing in solutions that will mitigate climate change and prevent large-scale death and devastation.  These investments will take time to pay off, but once they do it will have an exponential effect on CO2 emissions.  

Just like the effects of GHG emissions are delayed, the effects of our mitigation actions now will also be delayed, but once in place they will work much faster than our natural systems do. I mean, I wouldn't buy oceanfront property and there will certainly be a lot of struggles, but there have always been struggles, and we usually survive in spite of ourselves.

## Reasons To Not Worry So Much About "Tipping Points"

### Comment from u/grundar

> Now I am coming from a layman's perspective here, but the recent video by a scientist and youtuber I respect, Simon Clark, essentially confirms my fears in this regard

There are some key parts in the video's description that I think you may have skimmed past:  
> "according to this research, we could be triggering **some tipping elements** already - and if we warm the planet by just 1.5°C then we are likely to do so.  
> 
> The climate is still within our control. But **if we keep emitting as we are**, that isn't always going to be the case."

There's a long list of tipping points, some of which are *much* worse than others.  Which are the "some" we may already be triggering?

[I went through the individual tipping points in the paper in this comment in r/science](https://old.reddit.com/r/science/comments/x98eb5/risk_of_multiple_climate_tipping_points_escalates/inn2yo8/); the latter part of that comment addresses that question directly:

Looking at the nearer-warming (<4C), near-term (<200 year timescale) items gives:  
 * Barents Sea ice (BARI):  1.6C threshold, regional impact, 25 year timescale.  
 * North Atlantic SPG / Labrador-Irminger Sea Convection (LABC):  1.8C threshold, 0.5C cooling (3C regional), 10 year timescale.  
 * Low-latitude Coral Reefs (REEF):  1.5C threshold, 90% coral loss, 10 year timescale.  
 * Sahel & the West African Monsoon (SAHL):  2.8C threshold, regional greening, 50 year timescale.  
 * Amazon rainforest (AMAZ):  3.5C threshold, 0.2C warming, 100 year timescale.  
These changes would be bad (obviously) and disruptive to the regions affected, but are not changes that would put human civilization at risk.

The major changes in the list are either far enough away in terms of warming (which, per the paper's author as quoted [here](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/963785) is likely to be 2-3C) or in terms of timescale that there will be significant potential for mitigation of them.  In particular, if we follow the most likely-seeming emissions trends ([SSP1-2.6 to SSP2-4.5](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf) as per estimates at [Climate Action Tracker](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/cat-thermometer/)) temperature will stabilize and decline over the coming centuries, mitigating or potentially forestalling entirely some of the longer-term changes.

So this is a sobering assessment for sure, but it would be a mistake to interpret it as evidence of our impending doom.

***

Note that that last paragraph also addresses the second part of the video description I bolded -- there's virtually no chance we will continue emitting CO2 at the rate we are today.  That paragraph links to some estimates, but the *reasons* for the coming emissions declines are largely that the economics now favor clean energy:  
 * [Renewables are now virtually all net new electricity generation worldwide.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/01/renewable-energy-has-another-record-year-of-growth-says-iea)  
 * [World coal consumption peaked almost a decade ago](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/coal.html.html#coal-consumption)  
 * [EVs replace millions of ICE cars every year, and will be a **majority** of the global car market by 2034](https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/24/BNEF-Zero-Emission-Vehicles-Factbook_FINAL.pdf) or even [2030](https://bnef.turtl.co/story/evo-2022/page/3/1?teaser=yes)

***

So, yes, climate change is going to kill people, destroy ecosystems, and set in motion some tipping points.  The truly catastrophic tipping points, though, require either more warming than we're likely to see (>4C), thousands of years, or both, either one of which gives humanity substantial scope to arrest or mitigate their effects.  In particular, [we're actively working on scalable technology to pull carbon out of the air](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/carbon-capture-doe-funding-45q-ccs-direct-air/629624/), and humanity in 2200 is likely to be significantly more technologically advanced than humanity in 2022, so it's not clear that temperatures and tipping points will follow the "assume humanity does nothing" path.

### Comment by u/BlowjobPete

>the fact that this was published in a reputable journal, by reputable people, and people who's opinions I respect in this matter seem to be as concerned as I am, all add up to an absolute doomerism bonanza on my part.

There's a reason for the word 'could' in the title of the paper you linked. Even our best estimates can be inaccurate.

That all being said, you also have to take into account that this paper discusses the triggering of tipping points, not how long the effects would actually take.

For example, let's take the possibility of the Greenland Ice Sheet collapse. Our best estimates say [it would take around 1000 years to actually happen](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter_09.pdf). At that rate of change, we can deal.

# Nuclear War Won't Happen

From a comment by "John Dean" on [This video by Sky News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hATxnauync)

The use by Russia of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine is unlikely: 
(1) they are most effective against massed units of personnel and armour, and the Ukrainian Army follows NATO doctrine in keeping its forces dispersed, only concentrating them for attack 'punches' through enemy lines - although the consequences of a nuclear attack would be severe, the Ukrainians have prepared for this eventuality and they will not be cowed by Russian threats;
(2) Russia would lose the support of a key ally, China, and India would no longer remain neutral in its attitude towards the war - Russia would be left with few, if any, friends; 
(3) NATO would launch a massive non-nuclear response, for example it is quite capable of destroying the Russian Black Sea fleet;
(4) Putin could not be certain that his senior commanders would obey such an order - it could even precipitate a Kremlin coup;
(5) It would take time to organise a nuclear attack and the preparations would be difficult to conceal, and, as far as we can be aware, Western intelligence have picked up no signs of Russian weapons being readied and a target zone(s) being cleared of Russian forces.
When a man says he's not bluffing, it usually means he is.

From a comment by reddit user u/Amoral_Abe on a post titled "CMV: If Ukraine doesn't make concessions, then nuclear war is inevitable"

**Argument against nuclear war.**  
  
I'm fairly passionate about geopolitics and world events so I've been following this situation heavily.  
  
1.  Many people were expecting Russia to invade in February.  While many average citizens didn't think much of it, the US government was putting out warnings that Russia was planning on invading all the way back in December.  In addition, given the speed of the sanctions and the coordination of the EU and Nato on this, it's clear that these governments were aware of it and had already planned their reaction.  As far as Nukes being used, most of these governments are preparing for it but don't see it as likely given the ramifications Russia would suffer.  That's not to say it's impossible, just not as likely as Putin wants people to believe.  
2. The voting on these regions doesn't just play a role in voting.  There are several reasons why Putin initiated it.  
 1. Russian conscripts, by law, can't be deployed overseas.  This now allows Putin to openly send conscripts to Ukraine.  He was doing it before but in smaller numbers and had to conceal it more.  
 2. Russian troops are suffering from severe morale issues.  Putin hopes that the Russian people will be more motivated to fight, if they believe they are defending their country.  By making these regions part of Russia, Putin can declare that Ukraine is actively attacking Russian territory.  
 3. Putin hopes that these territories being part of Russia will give some countries enough cover to offer him some support.  Most countries see through the BS but Putin just needs to offer some cover to hopefully convince a few countries that they won't take too much political blowback by supporting.  
3. The rhetoric by Russian media is heavily controlled by the Kremlin.  They know the west is watching and they want the west to believe that nukes are on the table and that Moscow is all in.  When it comes to poker, if you're all in, you need to really really sell it.  
 1. However, other news stories from the media paint additional pictures of trouble.  The fact that the media is blaming local governors for recruiting the wrong people, shows that the recruitment has caused severe societal discontent that the government can't bury.  They are trying to shift the blame from Putin to local recruitment offices and local governments.  This means that the government is worried that they may not be able to even maintain control at home with this war going on and that the people don't care enough about Ukraine to buy into the Kremlin lies.  
4. Putin absolutely can still go back.  He still has control of the government but the situation is starting to get out of control.  Using nukes actually destabilizes things for him more not less.  The public is already shifting against Putin but they are also not sure if it's just the generals and local governors who fucked up and perhaps Putin is innocent in this.  Putin is trying to make it look like he's all in so that he can force Ukraine to the negotiating table.  
 1. Russia still has countries doing business with it.  China is currently a moderate ally.  They're not gung ho about how the war developed but they are willing to keep Putin propped up since they can benefit from it as long as it doesn't get too bad.  India is also eager to benefit off of Russia's weakened position.  However, after Putin made some more blatant threats, Both China and India met with Putin.  There is no way Russia maintains their support in the event of using nukes.  Without their support, Putin is fucked.  Not from NATO, but from his own political elite.  They lose everything in that move.  Putin can nuke dozens of sites and it won't change anything, he's finished if that happens.  
5. Contrary to popular belief, there are different ways to respond to nuclear actions.  
 1. This is possible if Putin is desperate enough but I don't think it would get there because of the ramifications for Putin.  If Russia nukes the Black Sea as a warning (hoping that won't scare off China and India or invite direct retaliation from NATO but still show Russia is serious).  NATO will likely begin shipping heavier weapon systems to see Russia defeated much quicker on the battlefield and send a message to the Russian Elite that nukes will lead to more NATO involvement.  
 2. This is unlikely.  Russia Nukes a military site but tries to avoid civilians.  NATO will likely heavily ramp up sanctions and China and India will likely begin cutting ties with Russia.  In addition, NATO will start becoming more directly involved in the war without directly launching major attacks on Russia itself.  
 3. This is very unlikely.  Russia Nukes a civilian location or city.  China and India are out and begin ramping up their weapons.  The world fully cuts off Russia.  NATO moves to Defcon 2 and mobilizes its armies.  There's likely direct strikes on Russian military bases in Ukraine and outside of Russian territory while the world begins breaking down Russia's ability to function at all.  Putin would likely be under severe threat of a palace coup.  The longer it lasts the worse it gets for Russia.  
 4. This is a Very Very Very unlikely situation.  Russia nukes Kyiv or attacks a NATO country.  NATO is at war with Russia.  Tactical Nukes are on the table for both sides but both sides will likely avoid nuking civilian populations.  China and India likely join in against Russia and China likely uses this as an opportunity to seize land that once belonged to China but is now in Russian hands.  Russia won't last as a country unless Putin is almost immediately removed (which is very possible) but depending on how the war turns out, things could get pretty bad for other countries.  This is a worst case situation and wouldn't get to nuclear annihilation until Moscow was under direct threat.  Tactical nukes would be first but would ramp up the longer the war went on.  There is very little chance of this happening.  
  
So, overall, while it's always possible nukes come out, I think there's a lot to suggest that it's very unlikely.  Hopefully this makes you sleep a bit better.
