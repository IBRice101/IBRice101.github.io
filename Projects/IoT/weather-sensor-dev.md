# IoT Weather Sensor Development

After coming top 3 in the [CENSIS IoT Hackathon](censis-iot-hackathon.md) I won an IoT development kit:

- LoPy4: a Micropython-programmable quadruple bearer board.
- PyCom Expansion board 3.1: Allows for IDE development from laptop to board
- Thunderboard Sense 2: Sensor-to-Cloud IoT sensor kit for development 
  - Relative Humidity and Temperature Sensor Si7021
  - UV and Ambient Light Sensor Si1133 
  - Pressure Sensor BMP280
  - Indoor Air Quality and Gas Sensor CCS811
  - 6-axis Inertial Sensor ICM-20648
  - Digital Microphone ICS-43434
  - High brightness LEDs
  - Hall-effect Sensor Si7210

I'll be using this to develop an indoor weather sensor for my flat
