# [APT Talk Title Here]

Talk given 2022-11-09

## Introduction

If you're anything like me, one of the biggest reasons you got interested in cybersecurity is because of these massive, sophisticated, James Bond style attacks you'd heard about in the news, you know, Stuxnet, WannaCry, the US Election tampering stuff. But have you ever wondered who actually did any of this?

Obviously the answers here are countries (or nation-states), you're likely to be thinking "North Korea", "Russia", "China", "The US", and other such entities. And you'd be right! But Who *specifically* does all this crazy stuff? What groups? How do they do it? And why?

The answer to these questions and more is what I'll be going over in this talk. So without any further ado, let's learn a little bit about Advanced Persistent Threats.

## What Are APTs?

APTs, or Advanced Persistent Threats are, as the name suggests, pretty bloody dangerous guys! Let's break down what each of these words actually mean

- Advanced: capable of sophisticated attacks, normally using malware, on targets of great importance
- Persistent: They just keep going, this in my view is the secret to their success, they have the resources, time, and backing to be able to continue going with an attack against their target for as long as they need. If you're in the sights of an APT there's simply no point trying to stop them
- Threats: Pretty self explanatory, they have the capability to inflict massive amounts of damage on their target

When you put all of these together, it becomes clear that they aren't your run-of-the-mill hackers. They almost always have the backing of some nation state actor or another, often being sections of the militaries and/or security services of respective nation states. This is to such an extent that many militaries around the world, including the UK’s Armed Forces, consider the cyber space to be the fifth dimension of warfare (after land, sea, air, and space).  In fact, the term “APT” was coined by the US Department of Defense in the
late 2000s to “describe cyberespionage efforts by North Korea against American national security interests”
