# My Talks

When writing a new talk, I often begin by writing an article on the topic I'm delivering the talk on, I then use this as the outline and pseudo-script of the talk itself in order to keep my head clear at each stage of the writing process. I find this is extremely helpful because you don't need to think about content, formatting, images, and wording all at once, you can instead focus on one at a time and move through the process better.

Of course an excellent side effect of this is that I also have an article ready to publish on whatever the talk topic is, so anyone who can't attend is able to read approximately what I said at the talk. It also really helps your CV, proving you actually wrote the talk, know what you're on about, and can explain topics clearly.

With all that said, here are the talks I have written so far! (Mostly for the Abertay Ethical Hacking Society)

## [UFOSINT: Open Source Intelligence and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena](UFOSINT/index.md)

Delivered on Mar 3, 2023 at [Securi-Tay 2023](https://securi-tay.co.uk/)

UFOs, or more accurately UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) have been a hot topic of conversation for many years now. In the popular imagination this kind of thing is normally reserved for conspiracy theorists and "documentaries" on the History channel, however in recent years they have become the topic of much serious discussion amongst scientists and various military organisations around the world. In this talk I'll go over some of the OSINT techniques used to debunk UFO conspiracies, as well as outlining some of the cases for which there is no conclusive explanation one way or the other (probably not aliens though).

Something a little different, a workshop I'm going to run on reverse engineering, once again aimed at beginners, to teach them how to win at Minesweeper 100% of the time. Includes such wonderfully interesting topics as Ghidra, debugging, assembly, low-level computing, and the hacker mindset :)
