Hi there! I'm Isaac! I'm in my 2nd year of BSc (Hons.) Ethical Hacking at ABertay University in lovely sunny Dundee, Scotland. I am also absolute garbage at introducing myself so I hope that the stuff on this site's a little bit better at telling you what I'm about than I am lol.

## [Linux From Scratch: Raspberry Pi Style - Part 0: Prerequisites](https://IBRice101.github.io/RPi-LFS/0-Prerequisites)
The beginning of what I hope to be a pretty great project, setting up an Apache Web Server on a raspberry pi starting from absolutely nothing! This first edition covers my journey setting up the development environment, starting from before I'd even touched QEMU (scary, I know!)
