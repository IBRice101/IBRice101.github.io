# Scientific Paper Notes

This page comprises the notes I have taken from a number of resources (linked intermittently) on how to read scientific papers, and producing a literature review

If you find this helpful, please consider getting me a meal deal :)

## How to Read a Scientific Paper Efficiently

Notes taken from [this video by Prof. Pete Carr](https://youtu.be/IeaD0ZaUJ3Y) of the University of Minnesota.

- **DO NOT READ THE PAPER IN ORDER**
- Structure of a Scientific Article:
  - (1) Title
  - (2) Keywords
  - (3) Abstract
  - (5) Intro
  - (7) Experiment/Methodology
  - (6) Results and Discussion
  - (4) Summary/Conclusions
  - (8) References
- An algorithm for reading a paper
  - Feel free to stop reading at any point if there is no interest in the paper
  - Three-Phase algorithm (he says two but its really three lmao)
  - Phase 1 - Survey the Paper
    - Read the **title and keywords**
    - Read the **abstract**
    - Jump to **conclusions**
      - If the conclusions are irrelevant there's no point continuing
  - Phase 2 - Read the paper
    - Look at **tables, figures, and captions**
      - This is what was done in the work
      - Doesn't take much time
      - Getting into details will slow down the reading
    - Read the **introduction**
      - Provides with background information
    - Read the **results and discussion**
      - The heart of the paper
      - Will take most time
    - Read the **experiment**
      - How the work was conducted
      - Only need to read this if you're really interested & need to understand what was done to understand the meaning
  - Phase 3 - Notes 
    - When done, you can stop 
    - Note taking is a good idea so you don't have to read the whole thing again
    - Lets you know at a glance what papers you need and do not need
- The faintest writing is better than the best memory

## How to Write a Literature Review in 30 Minutes or Less

Notes taken from [this video by David Taylor](https://youtu.be/TdJxY4w9XKY) as well as [the accompanying website](http://peakwriting.com/litreview/Index.html)

- Lit review is just a report (Don't let it scare you!)
- Is 5 steps
- Step 1: Extract Summaries
  - Write a paragraph from the notes collected in the previous section
  - Separate them into paragraphs and citations
    - In-Text citation at the beginning of each paragraph
    - Author's last name outside of parentheses
    - Refer back to the source ("the authors present...")
    - Year of publication only needs to be referred to once, in the in-text citation
- Step 2: Reorder Summaries
  - Reread all summaries carefully
  - Find similarities and difference
  - Reorder paragraphs into a logical list
  - **No single correct way to rearrange paragraphs**
    - Cause-Effect
    - Problem-Solution
    - Series of Advances
    - Myths-Realities
    - Ancient-Modern
    - Effective-Ineffective
  - Label each paragraph with a high-level overview such as the ones above
- Step 3: Divide Into Body Paragraphs
  - Combine or divide paragraphs (if necessary)
  - Based on two factors:
    - Factor 1: How closely related the summaries are
      - If the high-level overview is the same for paragraph A and B, combine them
      - If not, keep them separate
      - Also combine if the two paragraphs talk about something you can relate (geography etc.)
    - Factor 2: How long will the paragraph be?
      - Try to limit to 10-14 lines 
- Step 4: Shape the Paragraphs
  - Add topic sentences and transitions
  - Turn the summary paragraphs into real paragraphs
    - e.g., "as far back as 2006, XYZ stated that..."
  - If more than one sentence in a paragraph, new sentence or "thought bridge" must be added between them
    - First add topic sentence, e.g., "the call to action was headed by researchers who began to study Topic X..."
    - Then add thought bridge, e.g., "XYZ's findings were replicated in ABC's (yyyy) study, which concerned Topic Y"
- Step 5: Add Introduction and Conclusion
  - Introduction:
    - Do as normal
    - Use a sentence such as "the following literature review...", signals to the user that it's not your personal opinion, claim, or argument
  - Conclusion:
    - Open conclusion with a restatement of the thesis, brings the user back to the overall point
    - Common ending is to comment on any gaps or flaws in the research reviewed
