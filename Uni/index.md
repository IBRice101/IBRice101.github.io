## Year 1 Semester 1 - CMP101: Computer Hardware Architecture and Operating Systems (CHAOS)

- Grade: A
- Description: An introduction to the basics of computing, with a specific focus on hardware and operating systems. This module, along with a lot of other first year modules, is designed to get people up to speed, and as a result a lot of the earlier weeks' work is pretty trivial. Additionally, this is one of only two modules where an exam forms any of the final grade. 
- Coursework:
    - 1: I was given a small Arduino (Wemos) Microcontroller board, as well as some peripherals, wires, and a breadboard, and told to create what you like, I made a Caesar Cipher (Caesarduino) device that would output to a small LED Screen and display the number of rotations on a 7 segment display (50%)
    - 2: An exam (50%)
