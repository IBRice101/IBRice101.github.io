## Year 1 Semester 1 - CMP101: Computer Hardware Architecture and Operating Systems (CHAOS)

- Grade: A
- Description: Introduction to the core ideas of computer architecture for students studying the subject of computing, building a mental model of the functioning of a typical computer system that can be used to reason about system (hardware/software) behaviour.  
- Coursework:
    - 1: I was given a small Arduino (Wemos) Microcontroller board, as well as some peripherals, wires, and a breadboard, and told to create what you like, I made a Caesar Cipher (Caesarduino) device that would output to a small LED Screen and display the number of rotations on a 7 segment display (50%)
    - 2: An exam (50%)

## Year 1 Semester 1 - CMP104: Programming with C++

- Grade: A
- Description: Software development through learning to design and implement applications in C++. The fundamentals of classes and objects, including key features such as class descriptions, constructors, methods and field, together with method implementation through assignment, selection and iterative control structures. 
- Coursework: A program that emulated a fruit machine

## Year 1 Semester 1 - CMP109: Computer Networking 1

- Grade: B+
- Description: A basic understanding of computer networking.  
- Coursework: 
    - Portfolio (50%):
        - Wireshark HTTP Analysis
        - Wireshark FTP Analysis
        - IP Address Calculation
        - A Network Exercise: Working in Cisco Packe Tracer to emulate a computer network for a small-to-medium sized organisation with four distinct departments
        - Python Networking: A calculator that functions over UDP and TCP, where a client sends two digits and an operand to a server, the server works it out, and then returns the result to the client
    - An exam (50%)

## Year 1 Semester 2 - CMP102: Software Design

- Grade: B 
- Description: Some of the fundamental ideas of software engineering. Learn to develop and communicate designs for small and large-scale software systems.  
- Coursework: 
    - Unit 1 (50%):
        - Quizzes (50%)
        - Coding Exercises (30%)

## Year 1 Semester 2 - CMP110: Introduction To Security

- Grade: B
- Description: Introduction to the broad area of computer security within the context of current legal frameworks.  
- Coursework: 
    - Law Presentation (25%): A presentation on the computer misuse act and their equivalent in another country (we chose Russia, done in groups)
    - Investigation (75%): An investigation into an aspect of security of my own choosing. For this project I did a deep dive into Buffer Overflows, the history, what they are, how they're used, and ultimately, how one can be triggered.

## Year 1 Semester 2 - ELE007: Cities of The Future ELECTIVE

- Grade: A
- Description: This module will introduce the concept of smart cities, which brings together hard infrastructure, social capital including local skills and community institutions, and (digital) technologies to fuel sustainable economic development and provide an attractive environment for all (Department for Business Innovation Skills October 2013)
- Coursework: a group presentation on how cities of the future will develop in certain aspects, my group chose IoT devices

## Year 2 Semester 1 - CMP201: Data Structures and Algorithms 1

- Grade: A
- Description: Introduction to the standard data structures and algorithms that form the core of algorithmic thought in computer science that familiarises students with the idea of reasoning about the behaviour and performance of a computer programme.  
- Coursework: Comparing the speed of two algorithms that perform the same task - I compared the Boyer-Moore and Rabin-Karp string searching algorithms

## Year 2 Semester 1 - CMP204: Dynamic Web Development 1 

- Grade: A+
- Description: Dynamic web applications, through client-side and server side internet development. 
- Coursework: 
    - Unit 1 (40%): An exclusively client side website themed around a band or musical artist of my choice - I picked Daft Punk 
    - Unit 2 (60%): Building upon the previous site to integrate server side functionality using PHP and MariaDB (SQL etc.)

## Year 2 Semester 1 - CMP210: Ethical Hacking 1

- Grade: A+
- Description: This module develops a critical understanding of the tools used by Ethical Hackers to examine the security of a device or network. Students will systematically investigate a computer network for possible vulnerabilities.
- Coursework: performing a security assessment on a small company network - I was given three VMs, a Kali one and two Windows Server ones that were vulnerable and was told to hack it following a specific methodology

## Year 2 Semester 2 - CMP202: Data Structures and Algorithms 2
- Grade: B+
- Description: Introduction to some of the practical performance concerns in the selection and implementation of algorithms, using a range of case studies drawn from typical real-world applications. 
- Coursework: To develop a program that makes use of either CPU or GPU multithreading - I made a Mandelbrot Set Generator based on code provided to me

## Year 2 Semester 2 - CMP209: Digital Forensics 1

- Grade: A
- Description: The basic technology and techniques used to investigate cybercrime. A systematic approach to planning and implementing a comprehensive computer forensic investigation, particularly evidence collection and the reconstruction of events therefrom. 
- Coursework: To perform a digital forensic analysis on a hard drive discovered at the scene of arrest of an alleged criminal, the target was illicit images of birds and other ornithological material such as PDFs, audio files, and videos.

## Year 2 Semester 2 - ELE012: Film and Game Genres ELECTIVE

- Grade: A
- Description: This module introduces students to the cultural codes and formal content underlying the composition of popular cultural genres, as these are realised traditionally through films, and more contemporaneously through video games.
